# algorithms-and-dataStructures

This is meant to document my progress with data structures and algorithms.

## Installation and Usage

If you would like to download and run these locally, you can use the git clone command on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jon-D-Smith/algorithms-and-dataStructures.git
```

This is also downloadable through the github GUI.

## Usage

If you want to run these files locally, please ensure you download nodeJS on your local machine.

Example of running the binary_search algorithm:

```javascript
node binary_search
```

Example of running the fizzBuzz interview question:

```javascript
node interview_questions/fizzBuzz
```

## Categories

### Search Algorithms

- Linear Search
  - Linear search is O(n) and is best used on unsorted arrays
- Binary Search
  - Binary search is O(log n) and is best used on sorted arrays

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
  - Bubble sort is O(n^2)
- Selection Sort
  - Selection sort is O(n^2)

### Recursion

This category will include many of the previous algorithms solved recursively.

### Interview Questions

This category will include popular interview questions, or questions that could be prompted in an interview.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are a data structure with key value pairs. In javascript I will represent these generally in object notation, but could also use the built in set data structure for this purpose.
